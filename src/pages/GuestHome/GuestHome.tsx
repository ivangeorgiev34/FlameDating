              After a few dates and a few fun nights out, I met Emma. When I
              read her profile, I couldn't help but like her after her last
              sentence: "Looking for my lifelong super sweet." After texting for
              about a week, we went on our first date and I knew there was
              something special about her!

              To be honest, I had gone on too many FlameDating dates and was
              absolutely sure it was a non-committal thing to eat for no money
              and have funâ€¦ 3 years now a whole bunch of dates and memories
              later and I am married to my man from FlameDating, David!

              To all singles out there, especially introverts like us: don't be
              afraid to step outside your comfort zone. That's where you'll make
              a real connection. Tinder brought us together and I am eternally
              grateful for that.
